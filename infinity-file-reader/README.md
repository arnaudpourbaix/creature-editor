# Infinity File Reader for Baldur's Gate

## Description
It is heavily based on Near Infinity, so most of the credits go to Near Infinity's contributors.

Why did I wrote this? I wanted a java service able to read game files without any user-interface.
It will be used by my other projects (Creature Editor and Script Generator)
