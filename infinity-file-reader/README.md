# Infinity File Reader for Baldur's Gate

## Description
It is heavily based on Near Infinity, so most of the credits go to Near Infinity's contributors.
GNU licence should allow me to modify and distribute this tool as long as licence and credits are unchanged.
If I forgot anyone in credits, just tell me and I will quickly repair my mistake. 

While Near Infinity is a great tool, it is rather difficult to re-use its code because user-interface is completely embedded.
I needed a batch tool (or service) able to read some files (cre, spl, itm, ids). WEIDU was almost perfect for this task but it is written in C++ and is less portable.
This tool will be used by my other projects (Creature Editor and Script Generator)
